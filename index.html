            Cool, you know my name already! I'm 25, married, have a dog and live nearby Frankfurt am Main (Germany)
            when not coding or pushing pixels together or learning another new JavaScript-Framework :) I enjoy myself with 
            gaming, watching Netflix, playing with my dog or making trips with my wife.
            <br>
            Although I love web development as a hobby, 
            my dream is to surround myself with a team of professionals, work with them and learn even more.

                <p class="all-sections__project-section-text">
                    This Project is a Recipe-Book-App created with Angular.
                    The main part of the app was not the styling but more the functionalities.
                    Splitting up the logic into different components and services and also using rxjs library/ observerables
                    for better handling of asynchronous dataflow/events.
                   <br>
                    <strong>Features of the app:</strong>
                    The User can log in via Firebase authentification,
                    create Recipes, add the needed ingredients into a shopping list, 
                    fetch recipes from firebase and save them also.
                    The app is hosted with Firebase.

                    <p class="all-sections__project-section-text">
                        This Project is a E-Commerce Store created with React(only Hooks and Context API).
                        As you can see in my GitHub repository crown-clothing I also used redux in the project
                        but for this small project there was not such a big benefit as for much larger apps.
                        Context API is perfect for smaller Apps like Crown-K because it gives the user the same functionality 
                        without hurting readability. If the App would become bigger I would use redux.<br>
                        <strong>Features of the app:</strong>
                        The User can log in via Firebase authentification,
                        select items, put them into shopping cart and buy them(demo only) via the Stripe API.
                        The app is hosted with Heroku.
