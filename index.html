            Yeah you know my name already! I'm 25, married, have a dog and live nearby Frankfurt am Main (Germany)
            when not coding or pushing pixels together or learning yet another JavaScript-Framework :) I enjoy myself with 
            gaming, watching Netflix, playing with my dog or making trips with my wife.

                        This Project is a E-Commerce Store created with React(only Hooks and Context API).
                        As you can see in my GitHub repository crown-clothing I also used redux in the project
                        but for this small project there was not such a big benefit as for much larger apps.
                        Context API is perfect for smaller Apps like Crown-K because it gives the user the same functionality 
                        without hurting readability. If the App would become bigger I would use redux.<br>
                        <strong>Features of the app:</strong>
                        The User can log in via Firebase authentification,
                        select items, put them into shopping cart and buy them(demo only) via the Stripe API.
                        The app is hosted on Heroku.
